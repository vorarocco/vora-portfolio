                I'm a native of Thailand and who has lived in Boston since 2019. While working in tv production, I worked on a team that produce a highly-acclaimed biography of the IX king of Thailand for public brodcasting. I'm a creative problem solver and a hard-worker who thrives under stressful conditions and never misses a deadline. I'm a life long language learner: first Japanses, then English and now computer language.
